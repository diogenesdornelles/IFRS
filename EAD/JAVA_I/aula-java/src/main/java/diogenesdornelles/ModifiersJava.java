// Access Modifiers
// For classes, you can use either public or default:
// public The class is accessible by any other class
// The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the Packages chapter


// For attributes, methods and constructors, you can use the one of the following:
// public	The code is accessible for all classes	
// private	The code is only accessible within the declared class	
// default	The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the Packages chapter	
// protected	The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses. You will learn more about subclasses and superclasses in the Inheritance chapter
